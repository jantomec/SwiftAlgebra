# ``SwiftAlgebra``

Intuitive framework for basic linear algebra and Lie groups.

## Overview

Swift Algebra package provides a simple, yet powerful way of handling basic linear algebra and Lie group tasks. Everything is focused around a basic building block ``Matrix`` which is an abstract representation of the matrix we know from mathematics. It has been designed specifically with an intuitive access to submatrices in mind. This allows to write simple and clear syntax, directly corresponding to the mathematical equations you are trying to code.
