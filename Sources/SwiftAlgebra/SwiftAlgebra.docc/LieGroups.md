# Lie Groups

Use the integrated framework to easily access mathematical operations on Lie groups.

## Overview

Lie group functionality is essential for solving beam problems with geomtrically exact beam theory. Specifically, this includes groups SO(3), a group of 3D rotations, and SE(3), a group of 3D rigid body motions.
