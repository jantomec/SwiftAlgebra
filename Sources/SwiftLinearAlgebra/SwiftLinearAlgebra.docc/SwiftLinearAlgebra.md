# ``SwiftLinearAlgebra``

Intuitive framework for basic linear algebra.

## Overview

Swift Linear Algebra package provides a simple, yet powerful way of handling basic linear algebra tasks. Everything is focused around a basic building block ``Matrix`` which is an abstract representation of the matrix we know from linear algebra. It has been designed specifically with an intuitive access to submatrices in mind. This allows to write simple and very clear syntax, directly corresponding to the mathematical equations you are trying to code.
