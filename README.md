# SwiftLinearAlgebra

A small standalone package for linear algebra.

## Features

Currenlty supported features:
- Vectors are treated as one-dimensional matrices
- Advanced slicing
- Arithmetic operations on matrices
- Linear algebra (inverse and solve using LU decomposition)

## Installation

https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift_packages/adding_package_dependencies_to_your_app

## Requirements

SwiftLinearAlgebra includes only pure Swift code making this package cross-platform. The latest version of Swift is recommended.

## Usage

The following code snippets should help you getting the gist of it.

Construct an identity matrix
```swift
var I = 
```
We can then do arithmetic operations
```swift
var I = 
```
or even matrix multiplication
```swift
var I = 
```
We can also invert the matrix or solve a system of equations
```swift
var I = 
```
We can also extract submatrices while keeping the reference alive
```swift
var I = 
```
